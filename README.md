# Weather Wizard

This Python application fetches the weather for a given city. It's designed to be a fun and quirky example of using custom coding styles.

    ```bash
    python weather_wizard.py
    ```

2. Enter the name of the city when prompted.

## Custom Coding Rules

Just for fun, this project uses some unconventional coding styles:

* Variable names are reversed.
* Comments are in French.

## Challenge Accepted?

Feel free to modify the code, add new features, or come up with even wilder coding rules! Have fun!

Run the application:
```bash
python -m weather_wizard.main
```
