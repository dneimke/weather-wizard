# Running Tests

To run the tests for the Weather Wizard project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.

3. Run the tests using the `unittest` module with the following command:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

This will automatically discover and run all the test cases present in the `tests` directory.

4. You should see the test results in the terminal, indicating which tests passed and which failed.
